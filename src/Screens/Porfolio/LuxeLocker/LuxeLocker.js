          wanted to make booking and managing units handy and user-oriented.
          Moreover, the giant sought to make user management feasible for
          administrators. To pull it off, we knew we needed a mobile application
          for end-users and a dashboard for administrators, then integrate them
          so that, when someone registers, admins can automatically manage them.

          Luxelocker collaborated with{" "}
          <a href="/" className="hover:underline text-secondary">
            Maqware Solutions
          </a>{" "}
          to develop an outright digital switch, offering a seamless yet secure
          user experience and a backend dashboard for managing both local and
          offshore teams, and users simultaneously. After several meetings with
          stakeholders, the concerns were quite evident;
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="flex">
        <div
          className="w-4/6 2xl:text-[22px] xl:text-[20px] lg:text-[18px] md:text-[12px] flex flex-col gap-8"
          style={styles.Ourleadertext}
        >
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>System wasn't inline with the competitors</li>
            <li>Outdated Business</li>
            <li>Inability to track users</li>
            <li>No access log of users</li>
            <li>Had no mobile app</li>
            <li>No customer management system</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our teams started strategizing with the stakeholders to address
            these pain spots. In line with the blueprints provided by the
            stakeholders, we started building the app and dashboard
            simultaneously.
          </p>

          <p>
            Teams had to develop a multi-hierarchical dashboard that's easy to
            navigate yet supports the required features to fulfill the
            requirements. Additionally, the app must be integrated into the
            dashboard to keep the admins informed of the activities of users.
            Also, we had to suggest multiple 3rd-party Software Development Kits
            (SDKâ€™s) integration and testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our concerns centered on delivering this massive project within
            confined time constraints. To name a few challenges:

            Working with a totally remote team raised some concerns for Team
            Luxelocker, but those reservations subsided as we started delivering
            sprints as planned. Their team recognized the long-term potential
            advantages of working with a team that functioned as if it were
            their own.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given that multiple teams were collaborating on the project, we
            tackled the challenges head-on and made sure that the entire thing
            was delivered as planned, along with adding a variety of features to
            expand its worth.
